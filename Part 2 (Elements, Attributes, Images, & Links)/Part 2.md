# Elements, Attributes, Images, & Links
### Block Level vs. Inline Elements
#### Block Level
Occupies the entire line of the space where it is displayed. Each new block level element starts on a new line.
```bash
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<p></p>
<div></div>
```
#### Inline
Placed next to each other on the same line.
```bash
<span></span>
<strong</strong>
<audio></audio>
```
### Adding Links in HTML
Anchor element (inline): any links you put on your web page are going to be in between these tags
```bash
<a href=""></a>
```

### Attributes
Adds information to an element
```bash
<a 'href=""'></a>
```
href (which stands for Hyper reference) is an example of an attribute for the anchor element,this tells the anchor tag where we want it to redirect to when we click on the link.
